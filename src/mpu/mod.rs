//! Low-level MPU handling.
//!
//! The MPU allows to set segments of the memory space as protected. Write-protection will apply
//! only to userspace processes, while execution-protection will apply to kernel space too.
//!
//! Strong restrictions apply: the MPU can only protect power-of-two-sized naturally-aligned
//! regions.
